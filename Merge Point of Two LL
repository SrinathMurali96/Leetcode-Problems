Intersection/Merge point of two lineked list:

def merge_point(head1,head2):
        if head1 is None and head2 is None:
              return None
        temp1 = head1
        temp2 = head2
        d = []
        while temp1:
            d.append(temp1)
            temp1 = temp1.next
        while temp2:
            if temp2 in d:
                return temp2
            temp2 = temp2.next
        return None         
            
We should not compare with the temp1.data and temp2.data
We need to compare with temp1 and temp2. Here, we are comparing with node pointer, so the id will be same
