We use dummy to assign initial node which is returned as starting node. 
we assign dummy = new_node, which can be further used to add elements in a list

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if l1 is None:
            return l2
        if l2 is None:
            return l1
        dummy = None
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val > l2.val:
                node = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            else:
                node = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            if dummy is None:
                dummy = node
                new_node = dummy
            else:
                new_node.next = node
                new_node = new_node.next
        if l1:
            new_node.next = l1
            
        if l2:
            new_node.next = l2
        return dummy
