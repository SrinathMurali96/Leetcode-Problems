We use two pointer - slow and fast ptr.
Slow moves one step at a time and fast moves two times at a time.
We check if two elements exist (fast and fast.next) in while loop.

Eg: 1->2->3->4->5->6
Output : 4->5->6 

def mid(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
          slow = slow.next
          fast = fats.next.next
    return slow

If you want 3->4->5->6 as output , then 

while fast and fast.next:
    fast = fast.next.next
    if fast:
        slow = slow.next
return slow
