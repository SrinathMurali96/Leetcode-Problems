Nth node from last in LL in single traversal

We use two pointer - first_ptr and second_ptr
We move the first_ptr till n position.
Then, we will traverse nodes using both pointers where 
first_ptr from nth node and 
second_ptr from head. 
We traverse till first_ptr is None. So, the second_ptr will land in nth node from last
