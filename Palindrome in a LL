First find middle element using Two pointers- first and second ptr
Add the elements till middle in a STACK.
If the length of LL is odd, then add the middle element in STACK.
Then,pop every element from STACK and compare it with first_ptr

def palindrome(head):
      if not head or not head.next:
            return True
      first = second = head
      stack = []
      while second and second.next:
            stack.append(first.val)
            first = first.next
            second = second.next.next
      if second:
          stack.append(first.val)
      while first:
            if stack.pop() != first.val:
                    return False
            first = first.next
      return True
