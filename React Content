1. React is a JS library for constructing UI
2. It has a vitual DOM where all the changes are implemented first ie. it construct a new HTML tree. It also stores the previous tree and compare it with the new tree and writes
difference to the Browser DOM. This makes React to make the changes in the browser without reloading it.
3. React is descriptive. We tell / describe what we want. It performs the "How" part
